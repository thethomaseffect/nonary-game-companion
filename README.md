Nonary Game Companion
=====================

I really liked the idea of the Nonary game in 999 so I decided to implement a solution in JavaScript for it. You provide the door you want to get through and the numbers for the people present and click calculate. I may add the ability to provide a range or door numbers and return all the combinations people could use to go through in the future. If you wanna take a shot at it yourself send a pull request on Github.
